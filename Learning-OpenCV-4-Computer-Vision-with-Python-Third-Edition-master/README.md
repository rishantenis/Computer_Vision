**Get to grips with tools, techniques, and algorithms for computer vision and machine learning**

## What is this book about?
Computer vision is a rapidly evolving science, encompassing diverse applications and techniques. This book will not only help those who are getting started with computer vision but also experts in the domain. You’ll be able to put theory into practice by building apps with OpenCV 4 and Python 3.


This book covers the following exciting features:
* Install and familiarize yourself with OpenCV 4's Python 3 bindings 
* Understand image processing and video analysis basics 
* Use a depth camera to distinguish foreground and background regions 
* Detect and identify objects, and track their motion in videos 
* Train and use your own models to match images and classify objects 
* Detect and recognize faces, and classify their gender and age 
* Build an augmented reality application to track an image in 3D 
* Work with machine learning models, including SVMs, artificial neural networks(ANNs), and deep neural networks(DNNs)

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
import cv2

grayImage = cv2.imread('MyPic.png', cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)
cv2.imwrite('MyPicGray.png', grayImage)
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
If you are interested in learning computer vision, machine learning, and OpenCV in the context of practical real-world applications, then this book is for you. This OpenCV book will also be useful for anyone getting started with computer vision as well as experts who want to stay up-to-date with OpenCV 4 and Python 3. Although no prior knowledge of image processing, computer vision or machine learning is required, familiarity with basic Python programming is a must.

## Errata

* Page 244: Code should be
  ```
  for c in contours:
  if cv2.contourArea(c) > 500:
  (x, y, w, h) = cv2.boundingRect(c)
  cv2.rectangle(frame, (x, y), (x+w, y+h),
  (0, 255, 0), 1)
  if should_initialize_pedestrians:
  pedestrians.append(
  Pedestrian(id, hsv_frame,
  (x, y, w, h)))
  id += 1
  ```

#### Update about Optional Software Requirements
At the time the book was written, some of the code samples (in Chapters 6 and 7) depended on OpenCV's "non-free" modules in order to use the SIFT and SURF patented algorithms. Since then, the SIFT patent has expired and, starting in OpenCV 4.4.0, SIFT can be used without the "non-free" modules. There is now just one code sample (in Chapter 6) which depends on the "non-free" modules for SURF. If you wish to try the SURF sample, you will need to build OpenCV with the "non-free" modules from source (as per instructions in Chapter 1 for building from source). The pre-built `opencv-contrib-python-nonfree` pip package (also mentioned in Chapter 1) is no longer available.

## Troubleshooting and FAQ

### Issue: Camera input does not work on Windows

For some cameras and some versions of OpenCV, `cv2.VideoCapture` fails to capture camera input when it uses the Microsoft Media Foundation (MSMF) back-end. This issue may manifest itself with errors such as ``[ WARN:0@25.936] global C:\opencv\modules\videoio\src\cap_msmf.cpp (539) `anonymous-namespace'::SourceReaderCB::~SourceReaderCB terminating async callback`` when you run camera input scripts such as `chapter02/5-CameraWindow.py`.

To work around the problem, define an environment variable with the name `OPENCV_VIDEOIO_PRIORITY_MSMF` and the value `0`. (You may need to reboot in order for global changes to your environment variables to take effect.) This change de-prioritizes OpenCV's MSMF back-end so that OpenCV will try to choose any other back-end, usually the Microsoft DirectShow back-end, which is more compatible.

Alternatively, to specify the preferred back-end in any given script, replace code such as `cv2.VideoCapture(0)` with code such as `cv2.VideoCapture(0, cv2.CAP_DSHOW)`, which specifies Microsoft DirectShow as the preferred back-end. However, be aware that such changes may reduce the portability of your code.

### Question: Will the sample code work with the upcoming OpenCV 5?

The sample code in this repository has been tested successfully with OpenCV's `5.x` development branch as of August 7, 2022. Thus, as far as we can tell at this point, it should work with the upcoming OpenCV 5 release.

A future edition of the book will provide more extensive coverage of new features in OpenCV 5. See [https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Learning-OpenCV-5-Computer-Vision-with-Python-Fourth-Edition](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Learning-OpenCV-5-Computer-Vision-with-Python-Fourth-Edition).
